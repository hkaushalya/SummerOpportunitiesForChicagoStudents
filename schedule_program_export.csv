South Shore Chefs,After School Matters,"C-CAP After School is a culinary arts program designed to provide real world experiences for teens interested in a food service or hospitality related education and careers.

During each of the program sessions teens will work on basic culinary skills and techniques, returning apprentices will have the opportunity to be assigned a lead chef position which will give them the chance to show leadership skills and work on advanced culinary techniques. The apprentices will create a cookbook based on their own original recipes; some of these recipes will be showcased in a closing banquet at the end of each program session for invited family and members of the community. In addition to our current program, we'd like to also be considered to offer the following additional programming: I. For the regular school year, we'd like to offer a Pre-Apprenticeships program that will meet on Monday and Friday's. This program will support the younger teens (Freshman and Sophomores) who apply to our program but who may not be mature enough to handle the rigor of our regular apprenticeship. This will allow the Chef Instructors to work/focus on more basic culinary techniques and emotional development. This program will have the same instructors as our current Apprenticeship Program, South Shore Chef's. II. We'd like to offer a Culinary Arts focused Internship program that would operate year round. This program would offer a larger opportunity for After School Matters teens interested in Culinary Arts and Hospitality Management.
